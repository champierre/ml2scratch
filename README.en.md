# ML2Scratch(Scratch2ML)

ML2Scratch connects Machine Learning([TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)) with Scratch.

If you take a few images with a webcam, label them, and learn them, you can classify similar new images based on the learning results. The captured images are not sent to the server, and all learning and classification are performed in the browser. (However, a network connection is required to load the application at startup and to download the learning model.)

The block languages are English, Japanese, Japanese, Simplified Chinese(provided by 陶旭 https://twitter.com/taoxu_toukyoku), and Traditional Chinese(provided by
CAVEDU Education https://github.com/cavedunissin). If you would like to help us translate into other languages, please open an issue or contact us.

## Requirements

- OS
  - Windows 8
  - Windows 10
  - MacOS
  - Chrome OS
  - iOS
- Browser
  - Chrome
  - Safari(iOS)

ML2Scratch sometimes does not work because of some Chrome extensions. Plese switch to [Guest Mode](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6130773) in such cases.

## How to use(Step by step)

### Setup

1. Open [https://stretch3.github.io/](https://stretch3.github.io/).

2. Open "Choose an Extension" window and select "ML2Scratch".

    <img src="images/en/ml2scratch.png" />

3. Chrome asks you to allow the access to Camera, then click "Allow".

4. Check the checkboxes besides "label", "counts of label 1", "counts of label 2" and "counts of label 3" blocks.

    <img src="images/en/check_blocks.png" />

### Training

5. Show "rock" hand sign to the camera and click "train label 1" block. This is to train the machine to recognize "rock" sign as label 1.

    <img src="images/en/rock.png" />

6. Keep clicking the button until you capture about 20 images. The number of images captured is displayed in "counts of label 1" field in Stage window.

7. Show "paper" hand sign to the camera and keep clicking "train label 2" block until you get 20 as "counts of label 2".

8. Show "scissors" hand sign to the camera and keep clicking "train label 3" block until you get 20 as "counts of label 3".

### Recognition

9. After training, the recognition result shows in the "label" field in Stage area. If you show "rock", the "label" should show "1", if you show "paper", the "label" should show "2" and if you show "scissors", the "label" should show "3".

    <img src="images/en/recognition.png" />

10. You can use "when received label #" blocks and create a sample program like this:

    <img src="images/en/scratch_program.png" />

### Switching between images to be learned/classified

You can switch the images to be learned/classified.

By default, Scratch's stage image is used for learning/classification.

<img src="images/en/stage.png" />

If there is a webcam image on the stage, it learns/classified the webcam image, or if the "Turn off video" block stops showing the webcam image and shows a game or animation screen, etc., it uses that screen for learning/classfication.

If you want to learn/classify only the webcam's image, you can use

<img src="images/en/webcam.png" />

It can be switch to a webcam image for learning/classification. If you want to move the character by gestures on the camera image, I think this is a more accurate way to judge.


### Download/Upload

With ML2Scratch, you can download and save the trained model on your PC by using the "download learning data" block.

<img src="images/en/download.png" />

Click, specify the file download destination, and press the "Save" button. The learning data will be saved as a file &lt;numerical string&gt;.json.

The project itself is not saved automatically like a normal Scratch, so select "File" > "Save to your computer" and save it on your PC as a .sb3 file.

<img src="images/en/save_project.png" />

To reopen a saved project, choose "File" > "Load from your computer" and select the saved .sb3 file. After that, upload the learning data.

<img src="images/en/load_project.png" />

The saved learning data can be uploaded in the "upload learning data" block.

<img src="images/en/upload.png" />

When you click, a window called "upload learning data" opens, so click the "Select file" button, select the training data file (&lt;numerical sequence&gt;.json), and press Click.

<img src="images/en/upload_dialog.png" />

At this time, be aware that the data that has been learned will be overwritten.

## For Developers - How to run ML2Scratch extension on your computer

1. Setup LLK/scratch-gui on your computer.

    ```
    git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:LLK/scratch-gui.git
    cd scratch-gui
    npm install
    ```

2. In scratch-gui folder, clone ML2Scratch. You will have ml2scratch folder under scratch-gui.

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:champierre/ml2scratch.git
    ```

3. Run the install script.

    ```
    sh ml2scratch/install.sh
    ```

4. Run Scratch, then go to http://localhost:8601/.

    ```
    npm start
    ```
